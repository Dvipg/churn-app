# churn-app
End-to-End Customer Churn Prediction App built with Streamlit and Scikit-Learn.   The project contains a trained ML pipeline (`churn_pipeline.pkl`) and an interactive Streamlit web app (`app.py`) that allows both single-customer predictions via form input and batch predictions via CSV upload.
